											<p>My name is Adam Baker! I was born and raised in Geelong, Victoria. 
											My academic achievements are an equivelent of Year 10 completed through TAFE and I'm currently studying a Bachelor in Information Technology with RMIT. 
											My favorite hobby is self teaching myself to program games and experiment applications in C# using software such as Unity Engine and Visual Studio!</p>
											<p>Click <a href="https://ab-94.github.io/#"/>here</a> to visit my individual page!</p>
											<h2>IT Interest</h2>
											<p>I have had an interest in IT since I was i believe to be 6 years old, My mum and dad showed me our first computer and i was immediately transfixed by it. I played a game on an ABC website and didn't want to stop! ever since then i had a laid back approach to it, i used it for social reasons and gaming but never really decided to pursue knowledge on an academic level, however in my early teens i started to become curious about how to make my OWN programs. So i experimented, for the last 8 years i have been doing that on and off and only recently decided it was time to take my knowledge to the next level by studying a Bachelor in Information Technology with RMIT.</p>
											<h2>Career Plan</h2>
											<p>Adamâ€™s chosen position as a software developer requires experience in customer service as well as the required coding knowledge in java and .Net. He also requires prior experience in a similar organisation as well as the ability to multitask and work on several projects at once. Adam has decided to go down the path of becoming an independent game developer and programmer, after some thinking over and hard consideration, he believes that he would work much more efficiently. He is self-taught and he believes that he can achieve a lot by doing that. Adam has done some research and he has talked to developers in the game development industry and they have all told his that his portfolio is much more important than his degree. He will start by making his own projects, models, scripts etc. and then try kickstart his career through his portfolio or by creating his own independent company.</p>
