											<h2>IT Interest</h2>
											<p>
												I have had an interest in IT since I was i believe to be 6 years old, My mum and dad showed me our first computer and i was immediately transfixed by it. I played a game on an ABC website and didn't want to stop! ever since then i had a laid back approach to it, i used it for social reasons and gaming but never really decided to pursue knowledge on an academic level, however in my early teens i started to become curious about how to make my OWN programs. So i experimented, for the last 8 years i have been doing that on and off and only recently decided it was time to take my knowledge to the next level by studying a Bachelor in Information Technology with RMIT.
											</p>
											<h2>Career Plan</h2>
											<p>
												Adam’s chosen position as a software developer requires experience in customer service as well as the required coding knowledge in java and .Net. He also requires prior experience in a similar organisation as well as the ability to multitask and work on several projects at once. Adam has decided to go down the path of becoming an independent game developer and programmer, after some thinking over and hard consideration, he believes that he would work much more efficiently. He is self-taught and he believes that he can achieve a lot by doing that. Adam has done some research and he has talked to developers in the game development industry and they have all told his that his portfolio is much more important than his degree. He will start by making his own projects, models, scripts etc. and then try kickstart his career through his portfolio or by creating his own independent company.

									        <p>
									        	Allan, born 21st of February 1995, grew up in Melbourne's Eastern Suburbs where he attended primary school known for its focus on German language and culture. His high school career was rocked by illness, moving onto studying at Distance Education before finishing his VCE certificate at a local high school. In his younger days Allan was very interested in soccer, playing for his local team as captain for several years before his interests changed. For the last three years Allan has been working at a local Martial Arts school as their program manager, keeping everything up and working and keeping students happy in their classes.

											<h2>IT Interest</h2>
											<p>
												My interest and experiences in IT started when I was young, with my father showing me simple programming in Visual Basic he learned for his job at a pneumatics factory in the late 90s. He showed me how to make simple visual interfaces to make text change and start to develop little games from big books that captivated me at the time. I took off from there in my explorations of IT, learning several different programming languages, at the time to make video games and eventually working at websites and physical hardware as well. This all stemmed from those late nights with my father, expanding my interest both at that time and moving on into the future of this complex and fascinating world of IT.
											</p>
											<h2>Career Plan</h2>
											<p>
												Allan was our outlier in his ideal position initially being in IT Support. Allan’s chosen career path involved a lot of customer service skills as well as an in-depth knowledge of the software (in this particular case, Windows) or the ability to find solutions and workarounds for his clients. Being a customer service-oriented position, his technical knowledge would not be enough without the ability to communicate well with clients, supervisors, and any other personnel working with him. 
											</p>
											<p>
												However, Allan’s career plans have deviated from the initial ideal job identified (helpdesk/ technical support) positioning himself instead, towards exploring the space, and while still having that ideal job in mind, not closing off to other opportunities and engagements. A helpdesk or technical support role does seem to suit his strengths and proclivities, but in studying this unit he has discovered an enjoyment and competence in other sections of the IT world that may end up being a more ideal fit for himself. With this newfound information in mind, his new career plan would be to complete the first round of tertiary education and begin looking for opportunities in the professional space leveraging my previous work experience in other fields. He would be looking for different jobs and opportunities that come along, instead of strategically moving towards a position, but instead making moves as chance allows, and exploring IT and his own interests.

									        	Hey there I am Deon. I grew up in a city called Wodonga in Victoria, Australia. I have completed year 12 and have prior experience studying Civil Engineering. I have since switched paths into the IT field after becoming deeply interested in the field of software development.  My hobbies are playing video games and playing pen and paper RPG games like DnD.

											<h2>IT Interest</h2>
											<p>
												IT is less of an interest for me and more a way of life. I started becoming interested in computers when I was very young around the age of 6 when my father and my older brothers upgraded from their old computer to one that ran Windows XP. Countless hours were spent on it and that trend continues until today with me piecing together my own at 16.
											</p>
											<h2>Career Plan</h2>
											<p>
												Deon’s chosen position was a software engineer for VR and hardware. This position requires an extensive knowledge base and years of experience. Although not all jobs require this, having more experience will lead to a greater chance of obtaining such a role. Deon’s chosen role will require experience in game design, as well as specifically working with VR technology, interactions between humans and computers, and the use of software specific to the industry such as the game engines Unity and Unreal. Deon’s career pathway is centred around software development. He has spent time researching into the space around it and feels that his options have broadened. His ideal job would require a large time investment, and Deon thinks that the stepping stones to getting there are just as interesting. 
											</p>
											<p>
												His plan has changed and he knows that he must be much more open minded in terms of what it is that he could be. In his studies he has found that his interest in programming has elevated, and it has made him wish to start engaging himself into projects to develop his skills. His career plan has shifted into a more active one, in which he would be looking to either undertake projects in his own time or look for other opportunities to gain experience during his study. He would like to work with other people or organisations alongside studying his degree.

									        <p>My name is Kylie and I am a single mother of 2 pre-teen children, one of which is autistic, I have come to study late in life in my mid 30’s to begin pursuing an education I can use to further my career prospects once my children are a little older. I only completed grade 10 in my high school days and have been a stay at home mother for 12 years, so I have found the learning and time management around children something of challenge. I live in North Queensland and have in fact, never even left the state. I love to play video games and you can find me reading (usually a fantasy series) at least once a day. My secret little hobby is gardening, specifically I really enjoy growing adenium desert roses, and normal roses in all their wonderful varieties, colours and species. I am not very good at it sad to say but I learn more each day. </p>

											<h2>IT Interest</h2>
											<p>My interest in IT started at a very young age, my Grandfather began working with computers and teaching himself everything he wanted to know in the early 90’s. We were quite close and so I was often with him as he built a computer, or fixed them, or just experimented for his own learning. We had all the gaming systems growing up, starting with the Atari and the family often spent weekends out in our garage playing the latest games together. As I got older, I began purchasing my own equipment and teaching myself how to build computers and fix problems, both software and hardware. My current PC was purchased nearly 14 years ago and has died and been repaired many times by myself, it is still going strong. I am fascinated with the concept of game design and coding and really enjoy reading the rise of small companies making amazing games. If those guys can do it, then maybe I can as well.</p>
											<h2>Career Plan</h2>
											<p>	
												Kylie’s chosen position of mobile game developer also focuses on game development and the use of the Unity engine alongside learning other specific skills such as animation, coding in C#, and working specifically with 3D technologies, whether that was in games or other technologies. Her chosen position also requires previous experience developing a game that was successfully launched in the app or play store. Kylie’s career plans are centred mostly around the ability to work remotely as her personal circumstances as a carer and rural living arrangements, would make working an office-based job in a city impractical. Remote working on code and game design would be ideal for Kylie and she harbours aspirations to one day start her own company that caters to the needs of others in similar positions to her own regarding work. While she would need to gain much experience in her chosen field before launching a company of her own, she does believe it is a worthwhile career goal to focus on long term.

									        	My name is Tomas. I am 21 years old and I am from a town just outside of North London. I now live in Australia (Brisbane to be precise) with my partner and her sister. In terms of hobbies, I enjoy sport a lot, including soccer and weightlifting. I want to soon take up boxing or Muay Thai but just have not gotten around to it yet. An interesting fact about me would be that I am currently looking into and trying to set up my own alcohol distillery with aims to turn it into a business in the future.

											<h2>IT Interest</h2>
											<p>
												As I have mentioned previously, IT has always been something I have enjoyed, I just never really gave it much more thought than that. I have always been the family “tech guy” even though I am pretty sure most of the things I can do are minor. Alas, it has given me some encouragement to try the subject in greater detail and maybe make a career out of it. Or at least it will always be a handy tool with how technology-based our society is nowadays. If I could choose an area that excites me the most, I would probably have to pick learning how to code in a new language. As difficult as it may be, being a rookie, I find it very interesting and especially satisfying when I finally figure out what something means after spending an extraordinary amount of time trying to make it work.
